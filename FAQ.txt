Frequently Asked Questions:

Q.	What does QOR stand for?
A.	Querysoft Open Runtime.

Q.	What is the QOR?
A.	A free, open source, C++, cross platform, advanced software framework.

Q.	Is it done yet?
A.	No. See STATUS.txt for the current status.

Q.	Why would I use the QOR?
A.	Because you want to write your application once and run it everywhere, forever, at full speed.
	You want to be able to read, understand and change if necessary all the source in your product.
	When a completely new hardware platform, Operating system or toolchain comes along you want to be there first with your existing code.

Q.	How do I use the QOR?
A.	1.	Read a little about the organization of the QOR and decide how you want to use.
	2.	Configure it.
	3.	Build it with your chosen Compiler for your chosen OS and hardware.
	4.	Write your application against the QOR headers in QOR/include/
	5.	Link your application against the QOR runtime you built in step 3.

Q.	What makes the QOR special?
A.	The modular architecture and Aspect Oriented approach of the QOR mean it's easier to adapt to new platforms than other frameworks.
	The Aspect separation of the QOR means even the simplect applications can take advantage of advanced interception techniques and the integrated unit test framework with minimal effort.
	The QOR uses advanced C++ techniques so that you don't have to. It allows you to do as much or as little memory and object lifetime management as you want to.
	The QOR is designed to be extended. It is modular even at the sub-Object level so you can replace just the parts you want without re-writing or duplicating thousands of lines of code.
