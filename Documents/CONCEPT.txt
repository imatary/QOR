CQOR - The QOR C Library.

CQOR is intended to be a direct point by point implementation of the Posix specification, currently Posix 2008, to the extent that this is possible.
As such it should be maximally compliant with the Posix specification.
CQOR is also intended to be a direct replacement for glibc and MSVCRT, the two most widely used C Library implementations. 
As such it needs to be a superset of Posix and of those libraries at the interface. It is not however intended to have or to maintain binary 
compatibility with either of those libraries or any other. There are too many intractable inconsistencies between the current libraries and between
those libraries and the specification to attempt such compatability. As such rebuilding code against the CQOR may require minor adjustments.
These should be minimised to the extent possible.
CQOR is intended to be mostly a single layer interface library over platform specific implementations within the SystemQOR library.
Given this once CQOR is interface complete it should neither grow nor change very much becoming an effective Posix ABI which applications can rely on.

CQOR is built as a shared library in modular builds and as part of the single shared library in monolithic builds.

CQOR is intended to be complete at Strata-3
