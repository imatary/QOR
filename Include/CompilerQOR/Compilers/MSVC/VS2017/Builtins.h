//Builtins.h

//Built in universal intrinsic functions available under MSVC compilers
//These declarations behave like protoypes for functions in hidden/pre-compiled obj files
//The functions themselves only get linked in if we declare them exactly as they are here
//and then at some point #pragma intrinsic the function name and call it.
